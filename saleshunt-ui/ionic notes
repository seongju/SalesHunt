<directive var="data"></directive>

$scope.$apply

ui-sref="tab.dash"

href="/tab/dash"

$rootScope is acceblble for passing objects because mobile app wont reload at same url. Will reload at default $state. In Desktop, you can reload at url, so killing app and reloading would lose data.


parse deploy - use parse command line tool to deploy parse functions (written in JS) to Parse project


Key1 = "<!---- key from parse --->"

Key2 = "<!---- key from parse --->"
in app.js Parse.initialize(key1, key2)


//Query is in Parse->Guide->JavaScript
//API reference is useful after understanding Guide

new Parse.Query("Table")

Better to use Parse.Cloud.run(); -- write a function to control queries. Better than having raw queries.


added parse angular patch -- needed to call dep in bower, dep in app.js and load file in index.html

Parse login saved in html5 local storage
Parse.User.current checks in local storage

window.localStorage.setItem();
